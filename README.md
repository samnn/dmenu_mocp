This script is primarily the work of Calvin Morrison and the original can be found at https://github.com/mutantturkey/mocicon/tree/master/dmenu_mocp <br />
Thanks to Sascha Martensen's additions to inspire my own, found at https://github.com/pscha/dmenu_mocp

Inherit arguments passed from execution to integrate nicely with existing dmenu configs, usability tweaks to make it easier on the eyes and some error handling for edge cases.
